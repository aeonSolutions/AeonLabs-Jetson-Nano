<br>

# NVidia's Jetson Nano 
This is home for a new open hardware catalogue , one that uses NVidia's Jetson Nano GPU electronics.

<br>

my first project planned is....  <br>
an autonomous vacuum robot able to identify all furniture in a home

<br>

second project....  <br>
forget smart data acquisition of experimental data. This time is time for some Intelligent Data Acquisition of experimental data .  <br>
In a scientific research laboratory . And outside.

<br>

## Other Open Hardware Projects

### [NVidia's My Jetson Nano Baseboard](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/my-jetson-nano-baseboard)
This basic baseboard gives the user the foundation and the flexibility to design their own baseboard for the Jetson Nano. It also repurposes some of the Jetson Nano’s interface signals for simple beginner projects.

### [Antmicro's Open Source Jetson Baseboard](https://github.com/antmicro/jetson-nano-baseboard)
This project contains open hardware design files for a baseboard supporting the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Xavier NX and TX2 NX SoMs.
It was created by [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com), a custom hardware, software and AI engineering company and NVIDIA's Jetson ecosystem partner.
The board can be interfaced with MIPI CSI-2 video devices through a unified Flexible Flat Cable (FFC) connector, supporting up to 4 sensors in a 2-lane configuration or 3 sensors in a 4-lane configuration.
Please refer to the Product Design Guide for the relevant SoM for more details regarding the supported CSI lane mappings.
You will find the SoM-related resources in NVIDIA's [Jetson Download Center](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).
